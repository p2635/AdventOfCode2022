# Head is directly above, below, left or right

To help me visualise:

0
1
2
 0 1 2

- (y, head high, tail low) 0 - 2 =  -2 comes out to be minus, so tail must go UP to catch up
- (y, head low, tail high) 2 - 0 = 0 comes out to be positive, so tail must go DOWN to catch up
- (x, head ahead of tail right) 2 - 0 =  2 comes out to be positive, so tail must go RIGHT to catch up
- (x, head ahead of tail right) 0 - 2 = -2 comes out to be negative, so tail must go LEFT to catch up
