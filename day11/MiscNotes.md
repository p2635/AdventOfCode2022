Monkey
	items
		item (worry level)
	operation
	test (who to throw to, true/false)
	inspect count (how many times check item)

turn = one monkey going through all of the items once (in the listed order)
round = all monkeys have one turn

parse the text file, so the program is ready to go.
set up the loops
for each monkey in monkeys, throw starting items?

until 20 rounds done (length of monkeys x 20)? No wait, I need to set back to 0.
