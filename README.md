This is my repo for solving the [2022 Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

- Start Date: 03 December 2022
- End Date: I don't know if I can make it 'til the end!
- `/day1, /day2` folders correspond to the puzzles in the below checklist.
- `/input` stores the text I received for the puzzle input.
- `/tests` pytest files in here, I didn't write them for every challenge though.
- Coded on Github Codespaces originally, then realized there is a limited usage. Now I'm doing things locally, had to get used to fixing things and creating a virtual env.

Note: When I started this challenge, I was a python n00b so this made my brain work. I am becoming less of a noob as I progress.
